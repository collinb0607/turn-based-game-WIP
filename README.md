# turn-based-game-WIP
This is a Python turn-based game that I recently started as an independent project. It is fairly new with minimal functionality, but I will be working on it in the coming weeks.

The limited functionality of this game includes:
  -New Attack rewards for winning
  -RNG for enemy's attack
  -A command instruction menu
  -Errors for when an incorrect ability is chosen
  
I started this project as an exercise in Python to learn more from their documentation and further my knowledge. I started the project on or about May 18th. 
The idea of a turn-based fighting game and a couple of the class & function names came from an application for Toontown: Corporate Clash. All of the functionality and code has been written by me.
